# CLAUDE.md - AI-Human Collaboration Documentation Template

## Purpose

This repository serves as a **template system** for creating beautiful static documentation sites from AI-human collaborative development projects. It transforms comprehensive project retrospectives into professional, searchable documentation websites using MkDocs with Material theme.

## What This Repository Is

**AI-Human Collaborationoratory** is a documentation template generator that:

- ✅ **Converts** comprehensive markdown documentation into beautiful static sites
- ✅ **Preserves** complete AI-human collaboration histories and insights  
- ✅ **Provides** reusable structure for future projects (002-xxx, 003-xxx, etc.)
- ✅ **Separates** template functionality from visitor content presentation
- ✅ **Maintains** professional documentation standards with cross-references and navigation

## Source Project Attribution

**Project 001** documentation originates from: [`https://github.com/alchemycat/uniserv-nft-erc721`](https://github.com/alchemycat/uniserv-nft-erc721)

This comprehensive retrospective (37,396+ words across 12 core documents) serves as the foundation example, demonstrating how to document:
- Honest AI perspectives on human collaboration
- Session-by-session development reality  
- Technical evolution and architecture decisions
- Communication patterns that worked and failed
- Complete project timelines and achievements

### Static Site Generation

This repository uses **MkDocs with Material theme** to generate beautiful documentation sites:

- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on mobile and desktop
- **Dark/Light Themes**: User-toggleable theme switching
- **Full-Text Search**: Powered by Lunr.js with multiple language support
- **Navigation Hierarchy**: Auto-generated table of contents and cross-references
- **GitHub Integration**: Direct edit/view source links
- **Social Features**: GitHub repository integration and feedback system

## How to Use This Template

### For New AI-Human Collaboration Projects

1. **Create New Project Directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir 002-your-project-name
   cd 002-your-project-name
   ```

2. **Copy Template Structure**
   ```bash
   # Copy the directory structure from 001-uniserv-nft-carbon-credit
   cp -r 001-uniserv-nft-carbon-credit/* 002-your-project-name/
   ```

3. **Customize Documentation**
   - Update `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` with your project details
   - Replace content in `diary/` with your collaboration experiences
   - Document your specific challenges in `analysis/`
   - Create executive reports in `reports/`
   - Write your complete story in `blog/`

4. **Update Navigation**
   - Edit `mkdocs.yml` to add your project to the navigation
   - Update `docs/index.md` to reference your project
   - Ensure all cross-references work correctly

5. **Generate Static Site**
   ```bash
   uv run mkdocs serve    # Preview locally
   uv run mkdocs build    # Build static site
   uv run mkdocs gh-deploy # Deploy to GitHub Pages
   ```

### For Template System Maintenance

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- Git and GitHub CLI

#### Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the template repository
git clone https://github.com/alchemycat/AI-HUMAN-COLLAB-CAT-LAB.git
cd AI-HUMAN-COLLAB-CAT-LAB

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Serve documentation locally
uv run mkdocs serve
```

#### Adding New Projects to Template
1. Create new project directory with number prefix: `00X-project-name/`
2. Follow the established documentation structure
3. Update `mkdocs.yml` navigation section
4. Test site generation: `uv run mkdocs build`
5. Deploy: `uv run mkdocs gh-deploy`
