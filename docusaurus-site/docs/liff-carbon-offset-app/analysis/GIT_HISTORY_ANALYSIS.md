## Technical Debt and Refactoring Patterns

### Refactoring Commits Analysis
```
"Format code: organize imports and fix whitespace" (Jun 7)
"Clean up admin-db.ts route by removing 8 unused/redundant endpoints" (Jun 7)  
"Restructure admin dashboard: Make guest page view-only, add revoke approval" (Jun 7)
```

**Technical Debt Management**: The team actively addressed technical debt during development, not as afterthought cleanup.

### Error Handling Evolution
**Early Error Handling**:
```
catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
  alert('Something went wrong');
}
```

**Production Error Handling**:
```
catch (error) {
  if (error.code === 'INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS') {
    toast.error('Insufficient wallet balance for gas fees');
    await logErrorForDebugging(error);
  }
  // ... specific error handling for each case
}
```

**Evolution Pattern**: Error handling became increasingly sophisticated and user-focused as the application matured.

## Development Process Insights

### Continuous Integration Patterns
- **No Broken Builds**: Clean commit history suggests good local testing
- **Feature Branches**: Evidence of branch merging for larger features  
- **Hot Fixes**: Quick succession commits for production issues
- **Testing Integration**: Commits show evidence of testing before deployment

### Documentation-Driven Development
The repository includes 14 documentation files (7,877 words), indicating:
- **Learning Documentation**: Guides for LINE integration challenges
- **Process Documentation**: Admin workflow documentation  
- **Technical Documentation**: API and integration guides
- **User Documentation**: End-user instructions and guides

### Production Deployment Patterns
```
"Deploy to production" commits followed by:
"Fix production loading issue"
"Update production environment variables"  
"Handle production-specific edge cases"
```

**Real-World Development**: The commit history shows typical production deployment cycles with immediate fixes based on real user feedback.

## Collaboration and Communication Patterns

### Commit Message Quality Evolution
- **Early**: Generic messages  
- **Middle**: Structured conventional commits
- **Late**: Detailed context with business impact

### Issue Tracking Integration
Multiple commits reference issues:
```
"feat: Add NFT transfer by specific ID functionality (closes #41)"
"feat: Implement blockchain transaction status update endpoint (fixes #51)"  
"fix: Remove auth redirect from blockchain page to prevent unwanted navigation (#47)"
```

**GitHub Integration**: Active use of issue tracking for feature development and bug management.

### Code Review Evidence
Commit patterns suggest code review process:
- Multiple small commits followed by refinement commits
- "Fix review feedback" style commits
- Immediate bug fixes after feature commits
